        <h1>Interactive Essay</h1>
        <p>It descirbes the scene of what the people living in the cave see, thinking 
            that the shadow is a god, they praise it. However, they soon find out
            the truth that it is just a shadow of a diamond shaped figure.
            The essay illuminates the idea that there are multiple perspectives to consider.</p>

        <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
        <p>The story that I have chose is "The Fall of The House of Usher" by Edgar Allan Poe. Based on some of these text within the story, "The mansion, once grand, 
            now stood in decay, its once proud walls crumbling and ivy-covered...It was as if the 
            very soul of the house had been tainted by darkness, 
            and I could not shake the feeling of impending doom," I will be 
            creating a visualization of what the mansion looks like.</p>
