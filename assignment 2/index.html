    <h1>The Fall of the House of Usher</h1>
    <h2>Sadie Nguyen</h2>

    <p>For this last assignment, I have chosen the short story The Fall of the House of Usher, written by Edgar Allan Po, to create a visualization of. Making a visualization 
        of certain texts in this story aligns with Sousanis's emphasis on visual thinking and multimodal communication as it demonstrates how visual representation enhances 
        our understanding and engagement with narrative content.</p>

    <p>This story follows two siblings, Usher and Madeline, from the point of view of Ushers friend, who is the narrator. Themes of family, mental health, and the
        supernatural are elements within the story that capture readers into a world of gothic horror and psychological suspense that makes it mysterious and chilling. 
        With the main character being the narrator, which we readers do not know much about except that they are Ushers friend, I will be mainly focusing on the texts 
        “Usher” and "Madeline.” In the visualization below, captioned” Characters in the Fall of the House of Usher,” the check boxes show a visualization of where each 
        text is frequently mentioned the most at certain points in the story. The bottom of the visualization represents the beginning of the story, and the top represents 
        the end of the story. Checking off the first box, Usher is mentioned plenty of times throughout the story, as he is the driver and central to the plot. The story 
        revolves around the events surrounding Usher and his ancestral home, representing the decaying and decline of the family line, hence the name of the story, “The
        Fall of the House of Usher.” The second box shows a visualization of Madeline, in which she is not mentioned that often in the beginning; it is only an introduction 
        to her character. Throughout the story, her presence becomes more significant as the narrative progresses. In the visualization, we can see that she becomes more 
        significant in the middle and end of the visualization, which is where the climax happens. With both Usher and Madeline boxes checked off, they both interweave 
        because, during the climax, which is in the middle section of the visualization, this is where she is buried alive and reappears in front of Usher and the narrator, 
        confronting them and adding more suspense and tension to the story. In Unflattening, Sousanis discusses the interconnectedness of ideas and concepts and linking this 
        to Usher and Madeline, both words are visualized by a knotted shape, representing the intertwined fate and connection of their complex relationship between 
        the two siblings. It conveys the nature of the Usher family home and the blurred boundaries between reality and the supernatural in the story, evoking a sense of 
        unease and mystery. </p>

    <p>
        In this second visualization, captioned "Atmosphere,” texts such as “house,” “door,” and “wall” are being visualized as the whole story is based on the usher's 
        house, with the narrator detailing its ominous features, giving us readers an idea of what the Usher's house looks like.  
    </p>

    <p>By checking off the first box, the word “house” appears more prominently at the beginning and end of the visualization, mainly at the start as it aligns with 
        the storys opening scene where the narrator first encounters the house. As the narrative progresses, checking off the “wall" box, the visualization shows 
        that this word is mainly during descriptions of the house, which is at the beginning of the story and the end shown in the visualization. The narrator describes 
        the walls of the house as crumbling and moldering, reflecting its deteriorating condition. Furthermore, checking off the “door” box, this word consistently appears 
        throughout the story with it being shown in the visualization in every section of the story. It plays a role in shaping the narrative events as it becomes a point 
        for the character's interactions, serving as a symbol of transition between different spaces of the outside world and the interior of the house. Considering the 
        fundamental role of Ushers house, I decided to represent these elements with the geometric framework of a square as its symmetrical structure and architectural 
        foundations are commonly associated with traditional houses. The visualization is also shaded darker with non-appealing colors, representing the gloominess and 
        gothic style of the house, enhancing its atmospheric portrayal. </p>

    </div>

    <p>Overall, I am happy with how both of my visualizations turned out. However, something that I would like to change would be the shapes for 
        the second visualization so that each one would visually look like the word they correspond. I also would want to change the formatting of 
        the shapes in both visualizations so that it is more eye-catching. In the future, I would like to improve on those two things. </p>
