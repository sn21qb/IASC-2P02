    <h1>The Fall of the House of Usher</h1>
    <h2>Sadie Nguyen</h2>

    <p>For this last assignment, I have chosen the short story <i>The Fall of the House of Usher</i>, written by Edgar Allan Po, to create a visualization of. 
        This story follows two siblings, Usher and Madeline, from the point of view of Usher’s friend, who is the narrator. Themes of family, mental health, 
        and the supernatural are elements within the story that capture readers into a world of gothic horror and psychological suspense that makes it mysterious and chilling. 
        With the main character being the narrator, which we readers do not know much about except that they are Usher’s friend, I will be mainly focusing on the texts “Usher” 
        and "Madeline.” </p>

    <p>In the visualization below, captioned” Characters in the Fall of the House of Usher,” the check boxes show a visualization of where each text is frequently mentioned 
        the most at certain points in the story. The bottom of the visualization represents the beginning of the story, and the top represents the end of the story. Checking 
        off the first box, Usher is mentioned plenty of times throughout the story, as he is the driver and central to the plot. The story revolves around the events surrounding 
        Usher and his ancestral home, representing the decaying and decline of the family line, hence the name of the story, “The Fall of the House of Usher.” The second box shows 
        a visualization of Madeline, in which she is not mentioned that often in the beginning; it is only an introduction to her character. Throughout the story, her presence
        becomes more significant as the narrative progresses. In the visualization, we can see that she becomes more significant in the middle and end of the visualization, 
        which is where the climax happens. With both usher and Madeline boxes checked off, they both interweave because, during the climax, which is in the middle section of the 
        visualization, this is where she was buried alive and reappears in front of Usher and the narrator, confronting them and adding more suspense and tension to the story. 
        Both are visualized by a knotted shape, representing the intertwined fate and complex relationship between the two siblings. It conveys the nature of the Usher family 
        home and the blurred boundaries between reality and the supernatural in the story, evoking a sense of unease and mystery.</p>

        In this second visualization, captioned "Atmosphere,” texts such as “house,” “door,” and “wall” are being visualized 
        as the whole story is based on the house of Usher, with the narrator detailing its ominous features, giving us readers an idea 
        of what the Usher's house looks like.
