        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>
            They do not know why and how they got here but for their whole lives, these people have been surviving off bugs, distasteful water, 
            and surrounded by nothing but darkness, being known as cave people. One day, they encounter a strange entity shown on the cave wall. 
            In the eyes of these people, they see a pointy cornered shadow with a smooth top, misinterpreting it for a monster. 
            They are afraid and believe that it is the end of the world for them as they have never encountered anything like this 
            before. Upon seeing this new entity, they believe it is a sign from the gods. Being unsure why this shadow appeared, 
            they worship it as it has given them light and a reason to live within the cave. Sometimes the unusual shadow 
            figure would <span class="clickable" id="first-change">move</span>. 
            The cave people believe when it moves up on the wall, it means that
            gods are close to them, calling to them, resulting in them performing a dancing as well as a singing ritual, hoping it 
            would please the gods. When the shadow descends, they believe that they are straying away from the gods, causing them to go into a distraught state. 
            These cave people are constantly going in a repeating cycle of hope and happiness, to an end of the world mindset </p>

            Nick Sousanis's concept of “Flatness” refers to how everyone is viewing everything with a lack of depth, following traditionally 
            in one pathway. Nick Sousanis voices that we fail to view things in different ways and want individuals to evolve out of their 
            shell and expand on the perspective that they are used to. I believe flatness is the reduction of options that are presented 
            to us, limiting us to a single perspective. Flat thinking is continuously perpetuated when we simply accept what we are told 
            about the world. The people within the cave see the shadow figure presented to them in a 
            <span class="clickable" id="second-change">one-dimension</span> way. Living in the cave for decades with nothing 
            other than darkness and one another, they began viewing the shadow as the gods, worshipping it, and not expanding 
            their view any further. They view it as one, definite entity and do not consider any other possibilities related to 
            the shadow or its origins. <p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
        
        <p>
            Beyond the cave are creatures known as Titians. In order for these creatures to live, they must absorb energy over a span of 
            months. However, their precious possession has gone missing from its sacred place and is now isolated and floating in an 
            unknown abyss. Outside of the cave is where the titan's source of life is; a colorful, dazzling 
            <span class="clickable" id="third-change">diamond</span>, hovering in the sky. With the 
            <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">sun</span> so warm and brightly positioned behind the ravishing diamond, its 
            sunlight beams at the object, casting a shadow into a tiny crevasse in the cave. What the cave people thought was the 
            gods coming closer to them or the end of the world, was just the sun moving <span class="clickable" id="fifth-change">up and down</span>, indicating it is either nighttime.
            With the different positioning of the sun affecting how the shadows are shown, 
            the events and processes of the shadow are what the people in the cave would have never imagined as they 
            have no idea what the world is like outside of their comfort zone 
            within the cave. </p>

        <p>
            In essence, Nick Sousanis' concept of "seeing double" encourages individuals to have a mindset that allows them to seek 
            out different perspectives on the world. They can see through 
            more than a single lens and can recognize and engage 
            with the interconnectedness of ideas, experiences, and viewpoints. I believe “seeing double” is about being open to 
            different alternatives, interpretations and insights, understanding that there are often multiple valid ways of 
            understanding any given concept or phenomenon. The cave people have always lived viewing one perspective and do not see this 
            shadow in any other perspective except 
            their own, which is a sign from the gods whenever they are close to him or straying away from him by the shadow figure. 
            However, their whole idea and view on things will soon change. In the middle of the night, one of the cave 
            people that go by the name, Luey, climbs up and peaks outside of the cave through the little crevasse that the shadow 
            is being cast through, curious at what really is out there but is afraid to doubt the gods that they all worship. 
            Suddenly, rocks start to fall, making the tiny crevasses become big enough for Luey to squeeze into. He finally makes 
            it out of the cave and is faced with the truth. He sees the same thing that he saw in the cave, except now it has more 
            dimension and is colorful with a light source cast behind it. He turns around and sees 
            <span class="clickable" id="sixth-change">his own figure</span> just as strange captivating object 
            in the sky. By putting two and two together, he understands that what he has been seeing this whole time 
            was not a sign from the gods, but a dark and dull shadowed reflection of a the mesmerizing object within the sky. He runs back 
            to the cave quickly notifying the rest of the people that live in the cave about his new discovery, showing them a new 
            perspective of the world outside of the one they live in. </p>
