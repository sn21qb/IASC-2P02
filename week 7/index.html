        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>The shadows that are cast on the wall is a diaomond that is very scared to a certain type of species, left to right, 
            with its size still being the same. 
            In the eyes of the people in the cave, they see a pointy cornered shadow with a smooth top, misinterpreting for a monster. 
            They are afraid and believe that it is the end of the world for them as they have never encountered anything like this 
            before. The cave people have always been surrounded by darkness, living off bugs and cave water, and upon seeing this 
            new entity, they believe it is a sign from the God. Being unsure why this shadow appeared, they worship it as it has 
            given them light and a reason to live within the cave. Sometimes the unusual shawdow figure would <span class="clickable" id="first-change">move</span>. 
            The cave people believe when it moves up on the wall, it means that
            God is close to them, calling to them, resulting in them performing a dancing as well as a singing ritual, hoping it 
            would please the Gods. When the shadow descends, they believe that 
            they are straying away from God, causing them to go into a distraught state. These cave people are constantly going 
            in a repeating cycle of hope and happiness, to an end of the world 
            mindset </p>

        <p>Nick Sousanis's concept of “Flatness” refers to how everyone is viewing everything with a lack of depth, following traditionally 
            in one pathway. Nick Sousanis voices that we fail to view things in different ways and want individuals to evolve out of their 
            shell and expand on the perspective that they are used to. I believe flatness is the reduction of options that are presented 
            to us, limiting us to a single perspective. Flat thinking is continuously perpetuated when we simply accept what we are told 
            about the world. The people within the cave see the shadow figure presented to them in a 
            <span class="clickable" id="second-change">one-dimension</span> way. Living in the cave for decades with nothing 
            other than darkness and one another, they began viewing the shadow as a God, worshipping it, and not expanding 
            their view any further. They view it as one, definite entity and do not consider any other possibilities related to 
            the shadow or its origins. <p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
        
        <p>Beyond the cave are creatures known as Titians. In order for these creatures to live, they must absorb energy over a span of 
            months. However, their precious possession has gone missing from its sacred place and is now isolated and floating in an 
            unknown abyss. Outside of the cave is where the titan's source of life is; a colorful, dazzling 
            <span class="clickable" id="third-change">diamond</span>, hovering in the sky. With the 
            <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">sun</span> so warm and brightly positioned behind the ravishing diamond, its 
            sunlight beams at the object, casting a shadow into a tiny crevasse in the cave. What the cave people thought was 
            God coming closer to them, was just the sun <span class="clickable" id="fifth-change">going down</span>, 
            indicating it is nighttime and what they thought was the end of the world, it was the <span class="clickable" id="sixth-change">sun rising</span>, 
            meaning it was daytime. With the different positioning of the sun affecting how the shadows are shown, 
            the events and processes of the shadow are what the people in the cave would have never imagined as they 
            have no idea what the world is like outside of their comfort zone 
            within the cave. </p>

        <p>In essence, Nick Sousanis' concept of "seeing double" encourages individuals to have a mindset that allows them to seek 
            out <span class="clickable" id="seventh-change">different perspectives</span> on the world. They can see through 
            more than a single lens and can recognize and engage 
            with the interconnectedness of ideas, experiences, and viewpoints. I believe “seeing double” is about being open to 
            different alternatives, interpretations and insights, understanding that there are often multiple valid ways of 
            understanding any given concept or phenomenon. The cave people do not see this shadow in any other perspective except 
            their own, which is a sign from the Gods whenever they are close to him or straying away from him by the shadow figure 
            on the wall. However, their whole idea and view on things will soon change. In the middle of the night, one of the cave 
            people that goes by the name, Luey, climbs up and peaks outside of the cave through the little crevasse that the shadow 
            is being cast through, curious at what really is out there but is afraid to doubt his God that they all worship. 
            Suddenly, rocks start to fall, making the tiny crevasses become big enough for Luey to squeeze into. He finally makes 
            it out of the cave and is faced with the truth. He sees the same thing that he saw in the cave, except now it has more 
            dimension and is colorful with a light source cast behind it. He turns around and sees 
            <span class="clickable" id="eighth-change">his own figure</span> just as the pointy 
            shape in the sky. By connecting one and another together, he understands that what he has been seeing this whole time 
            was not a sign from God, but a dark and dull shadowed reflection of a mesmerizing object within the sky. He runs back 
            to the cave quickly notifying the rest of the people that live in the cave about his new discovery, showing them a new 
            perspective of the world outside of the one they live in. </p>
